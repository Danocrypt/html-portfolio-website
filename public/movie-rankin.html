    ll that it made me appreciate more why life is so important</p>

    <h3>Spectra</h3>
    <p>This ome is full of violence scenes but the part i loved was the fact that the enemies was speculate to be supernatural but they
         where in fact a result of a failed science experiment</p>

    <h3>In time</h3>
    <p>was a futuristic movie and i loved how the storyline was written, pretty amazing</p>
